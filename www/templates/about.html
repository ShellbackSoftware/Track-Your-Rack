      <p>Thank you for using Track Your Rack! If you have any questions or feedback - no matter how small - <a href="mailto:admin@shellbacksoftware.com" target="_top">send me an email</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as I can! Additionally, you can use the <a href="https://www.shellbacksoftware.com/project/issues/tyr">issue tracker</a> to see what is being worked on, what's known, and to create new issues. Further, you can see the <a href="https://www.shellbacksoftware.com/tyr/log">change log</a> if you're curious about what's been fixed since the last release!<br/><br/>

      When you log out, that'll destroy your current session. Any changes you've made will stay, of course. Any polishes you've added to the master list, changes to your profile, etc. All of that will stay. What gets destroyed is just locally used variables, as well as the credentials that were stored for your session. New ones are generated each time you log in, so don't worry about that! Therefore, if you run into any problems with data persistence, log out and then log back in. After you log back in, try to recreate the problem. If you can recreate it, send me a bug request either at the Tracker or an email directly describing the steps you took to recreate the error, and I'll fix it as soon as possible!<br/><br/>

      The "Home" tab is for the core uses of this app. You can view your rack, your Wish List, edit them, and share the link to them with your friends (even if they don't have an account!). That's also where you can add a new polish to the master list, or view the list of polishes that are currently in the list. <br/><br/>

      You can edit your profile over on the "Profile" tab. There, you can change your bio, website, name, or even add a profile picture if you haven't already.<br/><br/>

      The "Friends" tab is for people you're following. If you aren't following someone else already, never fear! Simply click on the "View Users" button at the top of the page, and you can search the current list of users, or just scroll through them for names you may recognize. <br/><br/>

      The "Chat" tab is exactly what you'd think it is. This'll paragraph will get fleshed out more once chat is implemented. Coming very soon!<br/><br/>

      In the future, I'll be adding in chat and a barcode scanner (for those polishes that come with barcodes!). <br/><br/>

      If there's <strong>anything</strong> you come across, no matter how big or small, definitely let me know! This is very much a work in progress. If the background color is bad, let me know! If you can't read text, or the text should be a different color, let me know! If there's any features I didn't mention that you would like, definitely let me know!
